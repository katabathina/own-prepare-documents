4. You have a common directory using mutliple users if any one create any file or directory in that owner will be owner group will be common group.

Ans:- 

1) Create a directory(sharing-folder) with root user.

2) Create a group(common-grp) 

Syntax: groupadd common-grp

3) Change group to existing folder sharing-folder

Syntax: chgrp common-grp sharing-folder

4) Chmod g+s sharing-folder  (Or) chmod 2775 sharing-folder

8) create a file in that group with any of user (sreedhar)

Syntax : touch sree1
 
Syntax: owner sreedhar common-grp sree1

Note: here other user can access but cant delete because sticky bit enabled  (chmod +t).

if any other users create any file or folder in this sharing-folder directory group name

common (i.e common-grp) because  (i.e g+s )

9. What is SUID(setuid)?

Ans:-

Ref link:- https://www.thegeekdiary.com/what-is-suid-sgid-and-sticky-bit/

Set-user Identification (SUID)

Have you ever thought, how a non-root user can change his own password when he does not 

have write permission to the /etc/shadow file. hmmm… interesting isn’t it? Well to 

understand the trick check for the permission of /usr/bin/passwd command :

Ex:-

# ls -lrt /usr/bin/passwd

-r-sr-sr-x   1 root     sys        31396 Jan 20  2014 /usr/bin/passwd


– If you check carefully, you would find the 2 S’s in the permission field. The first s stands for the SUID and the second one stands for SGID.

– When a command or script with SUID bit set is run, its effective UID becomes that of the owner of the file, rather than of the user who is running it.

– Another good example of SUID is the su command :


# ls -l /bin/su 

-rwsr-xr-x-x 1 root user  16384 Jan 12 2014 /bin/su

– The setuid permission displayed as an “s” in the owner’s execute field.

How to set SUID on a file?

# chmod 4555 [path_to_file]

-r-sr-xr-x 1 ce950 domain^users 0 Aug 30 15:19 setfile*


Note :

If a capital “S” appears in the owner’s execute field, it indicates that the setuid bit is on,

and the execute bit “x” for the owner of the file is off or denied.



Set-group identification (SGID) :-
----------------------------------

SGID permission on executable file


– SGID permission is similar to the SUID permission, 

only difference is – when the script or command with SGID on is run, it runs as if it were a member of the same group in which the file is a member.


# ls -l /usr/bin/write

-r-xr-sr-x  1   root tty 11484 Jan 15 17:55 /usr/bin/write

– The setgid permission displays as an “s” in the group’s execute field.

Note :

– If a lowercase letter “l” appears in the group’s execute field, it indicates that the setgid bit is on, and the execute bit for the group is off or denied.


How to set GUID on a file?

# chmod 2555 [path_to_file]


SGID on a directory

– When SGID permission is set on a directory, files created in the directory belong to the group of which the directory is a member.

– For example if a user having write permission in the directory creates a file there, that file is a member of the same group as the directory and not the user’s group.

– This is very useful in creating shared directories.


How to set SGID on a directory

# chmod g+s [path_to_directory]


10. Do you know MySQl?

Ans:-


11. Do you write quries?

Ans:-

12. I want to install tomcat in Mutliple Servers at a time how you will do?

Ans:-


13. What is default Permissions for a file? how will decide?

Ans:-

Default file permissions are 644.

The default umask 002 used for normal user. With this mask default directory permissions are 775 and default file permissions are 664.

You can setup umask in /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile file for all users. 

By default most Linux distro set it to 0022 (022) or 0002 (002). Open /etc/profile or ~/.bashrc file, enter:


14. What is StickyBit?

Ans:-

– The sticky bit is primarily used on shared directories.

– It is useful for shared directories such as /var/tmp and /tmp because users can create files, read and execute files owned by other users, 

but are not allowed to remove files owned by other users.

– For example if user bob creates a file named /tmp/bob, other user tom can not delete this file even when the /tmp directory has permission of 777.

If sticky bit is not set then tom can delete /tmp/bob, as the /tmp/bob file inherits the parent directory permissions.

– root user (Off course!) and owner of the files can remove their own files.


Example of sticky bit :
----------------------->

# ls -ld /var/tmp

drwxrwxrwt  2   sys   sys   512   Jan 26 11:02  /var/tmp

- T refers to when the execute permissions are off.
- t refers to when the execute permissions are on.

How to set sticky bit permission?
--------------------------------->

# chmod +t [path_to_directory]

or 

# chmod 1777 [path_to_directory]


15. How to restict user to allow only few commands?

Ans:-

Ex:-

16. How to list CPU's?

Ans:- 

lscpu
nproc

CPU(s):                4    --> overall Cpu's
On-line CPU(s) list:   0-3
Thread(s) per core:    2    -->
Core(s) per socket:    2    -->

Infosys:

1. How to add ebs volume to ec2 instance?

Ans:-

Step 1: Head over to EC2 –> Volumes and create a new volume of your preferred size and type.

Step 2: Select the created volume, right click and select the “attach volume” option.

Step 3: Select the instance from the instance text box as shown below.

Step 4: Now, login to your ec2 instance and list the available disks using the following command.
l
syntax:  lsblk

Step 5: Format the volume to ext4 filesystem  using the following command.

Syntax: sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

Step 6: Create a directory of your choice to mount our new ext4 volume. I am using the name “newvolume”

Syntax: sudo mkdir /newvolume

Step 7: Mount the volume to “newvolume” directory using the following command.

Syntax: sudo mount /dev/xvdf /newvolume/

Step 8: cd into newvolume directory and check the disk space for confirming the volume mount.

Syntax: 

cd /newvolume
df -h .


( To unmount the volume, you have to use the following command)

umount /dev/xvdf


==> EBS Automount on Reboot::


Open /etc/fstab file and make an entry in the following format.

Syntax:-

/dev/xvdf       /newvolume   ext4    defaults,nofail        0       0


Execute the following command to check id the fstab file has any error.

Syntax:-

sudo mount -a


If the above command shows no error, it means your fstab entry is good.

Now, on every reboot the extra EBS volumes will get mounted automatically.



2. What are the top level domains in DNS?

Ans:-  

A top-level domain (TLD) is the part of a domain that comes after the dot, for example, com, org or net ..etc.


Generally, you can divide TLDs into two types:-

Generic top-level domains (gTLD) :- 

Roughly all domains that are not associated with a country. The most known are com, org and net. All gTLDs fall under ICANN's policies.

Country-code top-level domains (ccTLD):- 

All domains that are identified with a country or geographical location, for example, de, nl or dk. A ccTLD always consists out of two letters.
